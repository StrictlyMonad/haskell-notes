# Introduction
The following notebook is my personal documentation process of articles/books/videos that I've came across and later attempted to reduce into smaller and comprehensive guide for others to benefit from.

The intentions of such actions is nothing but gaining the haskell community another repository which is striving to help increase the amount of people interest in the haskell language, as it deserves in my opinion. And if anyone shares this mindset and likes to help contribute to the cause, please do submit the change you deem worthy of this repository and I'll make sure to merge that change after evaluating it!

> **Note**: I am still a beginner haskeller as of today (2022-11-21), but I will become more pro-efficient and therefore increase the amount of written guides in this repository with time. Bare with me and if you cannot, do help me reach the end point quicker either by submitting a PR or creating your own repositry and sharing it with me!
